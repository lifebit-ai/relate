## About the ancestry processes

It was assumed the following for connecting the gcta process with the rest of pipeline:

INPUTS: 

-bfile 

WHERE DOES THIS BFILE SET COME FROM: It was assumed that the bfiles could be externally provided , however since we didn't have any externally provided bfiles then the internally generated by the pipeline were as sumed to be the inputs and  used so far for testings, these are "autosomes_LD_pruned_1kgp3Intersect_unrelate" bim, bed and fam files that come from the king_coefficients process as it is in its last version ( siteQC_funcs.sh ).

WHAT FORMAT IT HAS: we use the files in the format generated by plink2 as generated by the king_coefficients process for each bim, bed and fam formats. 

HOW IT CONNECTS WITH THE REST OF THE RELATEDNESS PIPELINE: We assume that the autosomes_LD_pruned_1kgp3Intersect_unrelate bfiles are so far exclusively internal inputs and have no parameters for bringing them externally but that could be considered too if such external files are confirmed.

OTHER INPUTS : We assume no other inputs are taking for this process.

OUTPUTS:  

"*. eigenvec ", " and " "*.PROJ.eigenvec " files
WHERE DOES THIS *.eigenvec SET GOES TO:We assume that the gcta outputs for *.eigenvec files and its complement "*.PROJ.eigenvec " (*.eigenvec file with NA's added as an additional last column) go into the infer_ancestry process that is run using the infer_ancestry.R script.

WHAT FORMAT IT HAS: we use the files in the format generated by gcta as generated by the gcta64 process from the Thanos code.

HOW IT CONNECTS WITH THE REST OF THE RELATEDNESS PIPELINE: We assume that the *.eigenvec file go exclusively to the infer_ancestry process and are affected only by the process in this step.

OTHER OUTPUTS: *.grm* files are also generated but not connected to any other process.
